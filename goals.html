                <img class="thumbnail" src="businesssuit6900481920.jpg">
                <p>My main goal for my career is to become my own boss. Through the means of software engineering and
                    coding and wherever my life takes me. </p>
                <p>In regards to software engineering, my goals is to become a freelance engineer. It gives me various
                    benefits such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There will be a lot of variety in the work I do</li>
                    <li>I can achieve a better work/life balance by deciding when I work</li>
                    <li>If I work hard enough, there is a constant stream of work</li>
                    <li>I am able to travel and experience new cultures more due to the nature of my work(more about
                        this on my next goal)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other than that, I am always eager to learn new things and gain new experience therefore even with a
                    goal set, I am willing to go wherever I am attracted to in the years to come. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h3 id="second(3)">Travelling, Culture and sports</h3>
                <img class="thumbnail" src="sunrise26244021280.jpg">
                <p>I am extremely fascninated by people, their stories and culture, and where they come from. To
                    experience this I have a huge desire to travel to most countries around the world. Not only to
                    travel but live there and experience their life in an authentic way. This will requires a high
                    ammount of dedication towards my career as a high income and various planning is needed. This,
                    however, is one of the motivation that keeps moving forward in terms of where I am in my life and
                    career. </p>
                <p>Other than that, I want to start partaking in extreme sports and activities. My expereince with
                    trekking and hiking during my gap year ignited a new interest which I didnt know I had. Whislt
                    travelling/experiencing new culture, I would like to test my limits and challenge my fears. Do
                    things such as bunjee jumping, paragliding, white water rafting, sky diving and many more that
                    pushes my body and mind to the extreme. I am lucky to have most of these facilities readily
                    available around me. I am in the process of planning to embark on this journey very soon. </p>

                <img class="thumbnail" src="guitar7563261280.jpg">
                <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. My grandad being a poet, musician himself and my sister
                    being exeedling talented in piano and singing, it was all around me since childhood. Apart from
                    being my hobby(go to hobby section above) I want to make something more out of music. I love
                    performing and providing music so alongside my career, I have goals to make music a recurring part
                    of my life. Performing in gigs and writing my own music would be what people say "dream come true".
                </p>
                <p>Along side this, further along in my life when I am completely settled, I would like to open my very
                    own music studio and work around other individuals with similar interests as me.</p>
