                <img class="thumbnail" src="blurry18541131920.jpg">
                <p>I was given a guitar at a very young age. It was my father's way of making me play less video
                    games(which didn't work). However, ever since I recieved my first guitar I have always been
                    facinated by the art of music. I first started learning small chords for simple acoustic songs which
                    led to me singing(quite horribly) at first but as I practiced more and grew older, I felt my self
                    get better. I perfermoed few gigs with a couple of friends from school during my later teenage years
                    where I sang and played the guitar.</p>
                <p>Recenetly, my interest in this hobby has grown further. I have
                    been taking singing lessons regularly and have managed to make a small studio setup in my room where
                    i make, record and edit my own music using a Digital Audio Workstation.</p>
                <p>My taste in music has a mixture of genres and music from all around the world. The genre I idolise
                    the most however, is Old School Rock/Metal from the 60s/70s/80s/90s and Late 90s/Early 2000s Pop
                    Punk. Due to the amazing talent in guitar playing, singing, performing and the artistic talent David
                    Gilmour from the old progressive rock band Pink Floyd, I regard him as my idol.</p>

                <img class="thumbnail" src="fengshui19607831920.jpg">
                <p>I come from a very spiritual background. Born in nepal, spirtuality was all around my during my
                    younger age. Nepal being a very hindu and buddist country, values its spiritual way life deeply. My
                    father and grandfather both being raised up in this eniverionment never failed to keep me in a
                    spiritual path. Due to this, to this day I view the world in a spiritual way. Beleiving in a higher
                    conciousness, energy of life and the universe and much more. I am very passionate about this topic
                    so feel free to contact me about this(my email is on the right).</p>
                <p>I am also very passionate about meditation. Seeing my father meditate from from a very young age, I
                    was bound to pick up the habit. I use meditation as a way to relieve stress, gain insight and move
                    forward from situations in life. It has played a big part of making me who I am and I am forever
                    grateful that it was involved in my life.</p>

                <img class="thumbnail" src="man12822321920.jpg">
                <p>This has been the most life changing hobby of mine. Since a very young age I was quite overweight and
                    for me personally, it was an obstacle that limited me in lot of my endeavours. </p>
                <p>However, during my gap year trip to China, I discoverd my passion in hiking/trekking. This was a huge
                    turning point for me as I lost around 30kg due to the new found interest. Ever since then, the idea
                    of carrying some equipment and climbing a mountain has been a huge interest of mine. Being
                    originally from Nepal, I am lucky to have had such amazing trekking spots in the country.(lick the
                    "goals" page at the top for more)</p>
                <p>Other than that, I am a fan of playing football. I also attend gym regulary and try to keep my self
                    as fit as possible.</p>

                <img class="thumbnail" src="videogame21544731280.png">
                <p>Like many aspiring software engineers, I have a massive interest in the world of gaming, technlogy,
                    anime, TV shows. I classify myself as a "nerd" in these things. I have been gaming for as long as I
                    can remember. Having recieved a SAGA genesis when I
                    was young, I was instantly hooked. At a later age I managed to put together a gaming PC buy
                    obtaining hardware online. This had always been a dream of mine (in the gaming side of things) </p>
                <p>I regularly watch classic and new Anime. I have been doing so since very young when my brothers and
                    sisters watched anime such as "Naruto" and "DBZ" and "One Piece". Similarly I like to spend some of
                    my "free" time watching TV shows.</p>
